  <h2 id="ancient">Ancient practices</h2>
  <p>Ancient tattooing was most widely practiced among the Austronesian people. It was one of the early technologies developed by the Pre-Austronesians in Taiwan and coastal South China prior to at least 1500 BCE, before the Austronesian expansion into the islands of the Indo-Pacific.[7][8][9] It may have originally been associated with headhunting.[10] Tattooing traditions, including facial tattooing, can be found among all Austronesian subgroups, including Taiwanese Aborigines, Islander Southeast Asians, Micronesians, Polynesians, and the Malagasy people. For the most part Austronesians used characteristic perpendicularly hafted tattooing points that were tapped on the handle with a length of wood (called the "mallet") to drive the tattooing points into the skin. The handle and mallet were generally made of wood while the points, either single, grouped or arranged to form a comb were made of Citrus thorns, fish bone, bone, teeth and turtle and oyster shells</p>
  <p>Ancient tattooing traditions have also been documented among Papuans and Melanesians, with their use of distinctive obsidian skin piercers. Some archeological sites with these implements are associated with the Austronesian migration into Papua New Guinea and Melanesia. But other sites are older than the Austronesian expansion, being dated to around 1650 to 2000 BCE, suggesting that there was a preexisting tattooing tradition in the region.[9][13]</p>
  <p>Among other ethnolinguistic groups, tattooing was also practiced among the Ainu people of Japan;[14] some Austroasians of Indochina;[15] Berber women of Tamazgha (North Africa);[16] the Yoruba, Fulani and Hausa people of Nigeria;[17] Native Americans of the Pre-Columbian Americas;[18][19][20] and the Welsh and Picts of Iron Age Britain.[21]</p>
  <p>There is no way to determine the actual origin of tattooing for Indigenous people of North America.[23]: 44  The oldest known physical evidence of tattooing in North America was made through the discovery of a frozen, mummified, Inuit female on St. Lawrence Island, Alaska who had tattoos on her skin.[24]: 434  Through radiocarbon dating of the tissue, scientists estimated that the female came from the 16th century.[24]: 434  Until recently, archeologists have not prioritized the classification of tattoo implements when excavating known historic sites.[23]: 65  Recent review of materials found from the Mound Q excavation site point towards elements of tattoo bundles that are from pre-colonization times.[23]: 66–68  Scholars explain that the recognition of tattoo implements is significant because it highlights the cultural importance of tattooing for Indigenous People.</p>
  <p>Early explorers to North America made many ethnographic observations about the Indigenous people they met. Initially, they did not have a word for tattooing and instead described the skin modifications as "pounce, prick, list, mark, and raze" to "stamp, paint, burn, and embroider."[25]: 3  In 1585–1586, Thomas Harriot, who was part of the Grenville Expedition, was responsible for making observations about Indigenous People of North America.[26] In A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia, Harriot recorded that some Indigenous people had their skin dyed and coloured.[26]: 11  John White provided visual representations of Indigenous people in the form of drawings and paintings.[26]: 46–81  Harriot and White also provided information highlighting specific markings seen on Indigenous chiefs during that time.[26]: 74  In 1623, Gabriel Sagard was a missionary who described seeing men and women with tattoos on their skin.</p>

  <p>Indigenous peoples of North America have a long history of tattooing. Tattooing was not a simple marking on the skin: it was a process that highlighted cultural connections to Indigenous ways of knowing and viewing the world, as well as connections to family, society, and place.[22]: xii

  <p>But those who paint themselves permanently do so with extreme pain, using, for this purpose, needles, sharp awls, or piercing thorns, with which they perforate, or have others perforate, the skin. Thus they form on the face, the neck, the breast, or some other part of the body, some animal or monster, for instance, an Eagle, a Serpent, a Dragon, or any other figure which they prefer; and then, tracing over the fresh and bloody design some powdered charcoal, or other black coloring matter, which becomes mixed with the blood and penetrates within these perforations, they imprint indelibly upon the living skin the designed figures. And this in some nations is so common that in the one which we called the Tobacco, and in that which – on account of enjoying peace with the Hurons and with the Iroquois – was called Neutral, I know not whether a single individual was found, who was not painted in this manner, on some part
  of the body</p>
